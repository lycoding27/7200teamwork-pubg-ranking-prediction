### Abstract
Our goal is to create a model which predicts players' finishing placement based on their final stats, on a scale from 1 (first place) to 0 (last place). We preprocessed the data and train 7 different models(Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc) with 9 features(Gold Diff, Kills, Structures, etc). Our program can automatically select the best model base on accuracy. Finally, we implement the UI by Play Framework. The users can input the information of first 15 minutes and then get the result of the match.
